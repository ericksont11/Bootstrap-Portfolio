                    <p style="line-height: 35px">I was born in Chicago, Illinois and moved with my family to Indianapolis when I was 11 years old. In high school I was the captain of my robotics team for three years and ran track and cross country for all four. After High School I studied Biology at Xavier University in Cincinnati. I recently moved to Cary, North Carolina to be closer to my girlfriend's family. I will not miss the weather in Indiana, and I look forward to starting a life here! For fun I like to read. I'm currently reading "All the Truth is Out" by Matt Bai. I also occasionally like to enjoy a TV show. I'm currently watching "My Brilliant Friend" on HBO.</p>
